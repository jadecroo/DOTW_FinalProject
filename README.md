# DOTW_FinalProject
Final Project for Drawing On The Web, NYU.

For my final project, I decided to do a series of drawings around my upcoming EP release, with each drawing representing a song: In The Breeze, Colors, Parti/Partout. I was inspired by using one element/concept/character to represent the ethos of each song.

I had a little trouble with Github about 70% into the project. Because of that, I uploaded a new folder with new files of my completed project and completed code. Unfortunately this means that a portion of my project was not controlled on GitHub.

I hope you enjoy this project!
